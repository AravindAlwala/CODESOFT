                <h2>Father of Indian Constitution</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>  14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956  was an Indian economist, jurist, social reformer and political leader 
                    who chaired the committee that drafted the Constitution of India based on the debates of the Constituent Assembly of India and the 
                    first draft of Sir Benegal Narsing Rau.Ambedkar served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru.
                    He later renounced Hinduism, converted to Buddhism and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement.

                    After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics,
                    receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.
                    He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his 
                    political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social 
                    freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.
                    In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") used by followers
                    honours him. He is also referred to by the honorific Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father".<a

                        Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow (now officially known as Dr Ambedkar Nagar,
                         Madhya Pradesh).[9] He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of 
                         Laxman Murbadkar.[10] His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. 
                         Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.
